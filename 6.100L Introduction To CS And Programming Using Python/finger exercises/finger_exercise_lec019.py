# In this problem, you will implement two classes according to the specification below: 
# one Container class and 
# one Stack class (a subclass of Container).

# Our Container class will initialize an empty list. 
# The two methods we will have are to calculate the size of the list and to add an element. 
# The second method will be inherited by the subclass. We now want to create a subclass 
# so that we can add more functionalityâ€”the ability to remove elements from the list. 
# A Stack will add elements to the list in the same way, but will behave differently when removing an element.

# A stack is a last-in, first-out data structure. Think of a stack of pancakes. 
# As you make pancakes, you create a stack of them with older pancakes going on the bottom and newer pancakes on the top. 
# As you start eating the pancakes, you pick one off the top so you are removing the newest pancake added to the stack. 
# When implementing your Stack class, you will have to think about which end of your list contains 
# the element that has been in the list the shortest amount of time. 
# This is the element you will want to remove and return.
