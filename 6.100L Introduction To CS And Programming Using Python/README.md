## üìù Topics Covered

1. **Introduction to Python and Basic Elements**:
   - Python fundamentals: data types, variables, input/output, and IDEs.
   - Strings, operators, branching, loops, and control flow.

2. **Program Design and Algorithms**:
   - Simple algorithms: guess and check, bisection search, and Newton-Raphson method.
   - Approximation methods, binary numbers, and floating-point arithmetic.

3. **Functions and Scope**:
   - Function definition, decomposition, abstraction, and scope.
   - Extras: keyword arguments, default arguments, and functions as objects.

4. **Data Structures**:
   - Tuples, lists, and list operations (mutability, aliasing, cloning).
   - Dictionaries: keys, values, and iteration.

5. **Recursion**:
   - Basic recursion, inductive reasoning, and recursion on non-numeric data.
   - Examples include Fibonacci sequences and Towers of Hanoi.

6. **Object-Oriented Programming**:
   - Class definitions, instances, and methods.
   - Inheritance, subclassing, and overriding methods.

7. **Complexity and Algorithm Analysis**:
   - Measuring efficiency: Big-O and Big-Theta notation.
   - Complexity of search algorithms (linear search, bisection search) and sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort).

8. **Extras**:
   - Debugging techniques: black-box and glass-box testing.
   - Handling exceptions and assertions.
   - Visualization libraries, hashing, and simulations.

## üìÇ Course Materials

The repository is organized into the following sections, which include only the code I personally wrote for the course:
1. **Finger Exercises**: Short coding exercises from lectures designed to reinforce programming concepts. 
2. **Lecture Code**: Code examples provided during lectures.
3. **Problem Sets**: Solutions to problem sets, programs that apply the core concepts learned in class.
4. **Recitation Problems**: Solutions to problems discussed in recitation sessions.
